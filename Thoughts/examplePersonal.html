        <div class="PostHolder">
        <center><h1 class="PostTitle"><span style="color: #ff9900; text-align: center;">Hello World</span></h1></center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hello world! It feels good to get this
          posting system atleast <i>slightly </i>worked out...</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I've wanted a way to quickly update my
          webpage with posts without having to format each post in HTML
          every time. There's <b>tons</b> of premade solutions but honestly
          none of them quite <i>clicked </i>with me if that makes sense?
          IDK</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To actually type these posts out, I'm
          using <i><b>BlueGriffon</b></i>. there's other options like
          Marked, converting markdown to html client-side, but that still
          wouldn't let me float photos/media along with the text without
          more HTML kajiggering. Honestly even this bluegriffon solution is
          half baked as I want one singlular program to write the posts in,
          that also updates the JSON and pushes to neocities using the API,
          but it atleast lets me edit posts as if it's a regular word
          editor, and just gives me the HTML without any hassle or
          inbetween. WYSIWYG editors are dying but it's good to know there's
          still SOMETHING out there for HTML5. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Well, how have you been, fellow reader?
          I've been pretty good myself. This post is a test more than
          anything but It's still nice to finally update the site.I feel
          like at this point most of the possum den is half baked, half
          implented solutions, but hey! greatness has to start somewhere
          right? </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This whole website is my first
          exploration of HTML, CSS, JS...I care less about how the code
          looks on the backend, than how it actually functions and looks to
          users. The whole basis of my site and how parts are sectioned off
          comes from an initial misunderstanding of how tables work. It's
          fun to bodge together projects. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If this post has any purpose, I hope it
          inspires someone else to bodge together something. who cares if
          the HTML is a cascades nightmare, who cares if youre mixing tables
          and flexboxes...BE FREE, CREATE, YOU BEAUTIFUL CREATURE! </p>
