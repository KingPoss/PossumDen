        <p class="floatLeftParagraph">I created my neocities site all the way back in 2021, on june 16th. As I write this, it is now june 4th, 2024. Nearly three years have passed, and I've watched my site develop from the "Welcome to neocitites" landing page, to what it is today! Often the only experience other people will have of my site is a static one. Pages may get updated, but it mainly stays the same. When I look at my site, I see all the incremental growth and change all the pages have been through. To those that don't webmaster their own site(s), I feel personal webpages can be kind of daunting in a "where do you even start" kind of way, but the truth is, personal sites are the culmination of incremental growth and change. Tons of experimentation, troubleshooting, etc etc. I think that's what makes personal sites so, well...personal. Not only do creators pour their soul into the content on their site (art, poems, blog posts, etc), the very site itself is the manifestation of their expression and creativity. What fonts do they choose? Whats their color scheme? How do they choose to lay out their site? Did they make it from scratch? use a template? Is there music playing on the page? All of it says something about the creator, and I think that's beautiful.<br>Personal websites are art. Beautiful little walled gardens of raw expression. I'm proud of my own, and I'll always love exploring others. <3</p>
