        <div class="PostHolder">
        <center><h1 class="PostTitle">Getting back to it</h1></center> 
        <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It’s
            funny, despite being a <i><b>PERSONAL</b></i> site which I run with
            <i><b>NO</b></i> obligation to anyone but myself, I still feel like
            I’m letting someone down by not updating my site, or when I miss
            radio shows.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The
            fact of the matter is, no one <i><span style="text-decoration: none">really</span></i>
            joins the broadcast unless I post about it in different chats
            (partially because when I actually follow through on broadcasts is so
            erratic), so there’s not much lost. Still, I wanna get better about
            posting more, if not for anyone else but for myself. It feels good to
            write, it feels good to create, but GOSH is it hard!</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It’s
            not like I’ve been lazing around though! A good bit happened in the
            few months it’s taken me to pick the site back up. Donald trump was
            elected as fucking president, that’s something we’re still trying
            to prepare for...getting passports, securing our marriage, etc etc.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Oh!
            speaking of, My girl and I are getting married! We’ve got our
            ceremony scheduled for the 27<sup>th</sup> of this month, and
            honestly I couldn’t be more excited. Trying to work on writing
            vows. When we first started dating, she gave me a painting along with
            a letter she wrote talking about us. It’s super sweet and I can’t
            wait to read it, looking back on where we were and where we are now.
            She just lights up my world.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">On the
            weekends and in between shifts at work, when we’re not running
            errands or lazin’ out together, we fish! We’ve got two solid
            lakes that are pretty close to us. We like to get there at or right
            before sunrise, but the frigid mountain air has made that a challenge
            as of late. Sure you can bundle up, but WHEW sometimes that cold just
            bites right through you. She’s been targeting largemouth, and I
            mainly find myself fishing for trout. They’re tasty, fun to catch,
            and the CDFW stocks them in both lakes, so your take can be pretty
            bountiful. It’s such a <i><u>peaceful</u></i> hobby. We’re new to
            it, but we already know we’re gonna be lifetime anglers. That’s
            partially why I’ve been so preoccupied and find myself updating my
            site less; being out on the lake is just too damn nice. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I’m
            gonna try to post more. I always look at what I write and feel like
            I’m rambling, but maybe that’s the point. Let loose, let the
            thoughts fall onto the page.</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Guess
            the only way to feel like a better writer is to write more!</p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
