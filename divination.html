<h1>Welcome to the Static Veil Divination Tool</h1>
<img src="/assets/tv.png" alt="The Static Veil">
<p>If you were born any time before the late 2000s, you no doubt have seen the cosmically random beauty of television static in person. To most, its no more significant than the "No input" screen we get from modern digital displays. Just an indication nothing is plugged in. But to anyone who's sat in front of it for long enough, eventually, shapes start to form. Things begin to push from beyond the viel. For the naturally attuned, or the experienced watcher, those shapes can grow into visions of the future, the past, or even distant locations (remote viewing). This is the real power behind the static. It can be used as a cheap and highly effective divination tool.<br>Unfortunately, with the prevelance of digital displays, being able to sit in the comfort of your own room or home and peer into the beyond has become a rarity. I've often thought of purchasing an old CRT strictly for divination (and the occasional retro game), but they take up a lot of real estate, and shipping costs are BOUND to be astronomical if you can't find one locally. This is where I got the idea for the following webpage. Can digital static really be used for divination? Well, yes! After a good bit of experimentation, I've found it works just as well as the old CRTs used to. I don't know what metaphysical (or metadigital) properties allow for this, but the results are all there.</p>
<h1>How to use:</h1>
<li>Ensure you are in a quiet, undisturbed environment.</li>
<li>Sit comfortably and allow your mind to go still. Place an intention, and <i>only</i> an intention, i.e. "I will see the treacherous snakes around me.", "I will know my future self.", you are NOT asking questions.</li>
<li>Stare into the static, but not at a single point, allow your eyes to unfocus and take it all in at once. (this is best done in fullscreen in your browser)</li>
<li>How long it takes for the static to change is entirely dependent on the person, their environment, and their respect of the activity. It can take minutes, hours, or even require multiple viewing sessions.</li>
<li>It can be easier to start without the white noise. The inexperienced or feeble minded may experience unpleasant audio "hallucinations", but as long as you don't respond to them you'll be fine.</li>
<li>Approach each session with respect and seriousness. Misuse can lead to unreliable readings and negative experiences.</li>

<h1 class="warning">PLEASE HEED THESE WARNINGS, THIS IS NOT A TOY AND SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED WITH:</h1>
<li>Listening to the static while mentally vulnerable can lead to visual and auditory "hallucinations" and general disorientation. It may distort your sense of reality and time.</li>
<li>Recording the static or white noise may capture ethereal voices or sounds that could manifest in unexpected and disturbing ways. Playback can anchor these entities to your environment.</li>
<li>Asking questions or seeking guidance through the static can result in misleading or harmful responses from unknown entities. Their intentions are not trustworthy.</li>
<li>Do not touch any screen emitting the static for prolonged periods. Physical contact can create a connection between you and these entities.</li>
<li>If you hear whispers or voices in the static, do not respond. Acknowledging these sounds can lead to persistent haunting or spiritual attachment.</li>
<li>Combining static with reflective surfaces like mirrors can create gateways for entities to cross over into our world. This can result in severe spiritual disturbances.</li>
<li>Do not overuse. Limit your use of the tool to prevent dependency and ensure clear, focused sessions.</li>
<li>NEVER try to speak to the dead through the static. It isn't really them you're talking to, as much as they sound like it.</li>
