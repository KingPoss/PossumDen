<h2>Welcome to my den!</h2>
<p class="intro">
  Hello! Thanks for checkin' my site out! I'm KingPoss, or KP for short. This place has become my home and creative outlet on the net. Outside of messaging platforms like Signal & Discord, you won't find me anywhere else. Like just about everyone else on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, I've become entirely disillusioned with social media, web 3.0 (and 2.0 for that matter), and the general state of the net in modern times. It feels good to stake a claim and make my corner of the web--take back a bit of landscape in this digital serfdom we're all serving under lol. Here, you'll find my <a href="art.html">art n pictures</a>, <a href="/Thoughts/MainBlogPage.html">writings</a>, <a href="/projects/projects.html">projects</a>, <a href="programs.html">programs</a>, and a <a href="radio.html">radio station</a> I run with scheduled live broadcasts & interviews! I implore you to check out the music, learn a lil <a href="about.html">about me</a>, and check out some of the other <a href="sites.html">awesome sites</a> here on Neocities. Oh, and there's a <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> you can sign too! I hope you have fun lookin around!

        <p class="postBody">Well, here we are folks! It's been about two years since i've even bothered to update thie site/webmaster update field...the way I had it layed out before was just WAAAY to cumbersome to update with any sortof frequency.<br>I went through and refactored just about all of my webpages. The CSS has been organized and split up into several files, scripts have been moved from within the HTML to their own seperate JS files, I reworked how the gallery and blogging system worked in regards to tags, and my guestbook has been migrated over from 123guestbook, to a widget VirtualObserver made that utilizes Google Forms/Sheets. It's pretty handy, and now my guestbook page is responsive on mobile too! The blogging system has been simplified and should make updating the site in general a whole lot easier and stress free. You can inspect element on my site without me feeling TOTAL shame now, so that's a plus LOL. More updates coming soon. Hopefully there won't be another 2 years inbetween this and the next one! </p>

        <p class="postBody">I needed to take a short lil break--I got busy with other projects, like a game I'm starting to work on, and a tool I've been making for work! KP Radio has a schedule, and it's about time I start sticking to it :3<br>I'm beginning work on assembelling a proper broadcast routine and "script", or rough guide to what I plan on talking about/playing. I've basically just been going off the cuff for the handfuls of broadcasts i've already done, and while it's still super fun, KP Radio deserves a lil bit more structure to it!<br>Oh, another thing: <a href="https://kpradio.net">KPradio.net</a> will now redirect to the radio webpage here on my site, to make it easier for people to share and remember!</p>

Yesterweb Radio inspired me to make my own internet radio station, but I wanted to do something a bit different!<br>Not only is the auto-DJ playing tracker music, indie music from small time artists around the net, fake advertisments, and "real" advertisments for other neocities sites, but I'm also gonna be doing live broadcasts where I DJ, as well as live interviews with other webmasters, artists, musicians, and anyone else!</p>
