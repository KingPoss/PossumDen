TODO:

XXX1. Update index site update page with new layout from radio.html broadcast recording code, will have to refactor some as index should have title on one side, date on other. might change? xxxxx
xxx2. Split up the featured artist page into multiple lists, like what was done with the sharing widgets. side by side, multiple rows. maybe have them reorder randomly?
3. Possibly change how assets are organized - i think having more folders could be good
4. Add 88x31 button back to index page, maybe create a new one
5. Sub rosa. go somewhere with that maybe
6. Idea - weekly broadcasts add an ad on the index page by default. it would appear only on certain days of the week. might be bad if not integrated with google calendar. if i dont broadcast, it will still show up. can we fix this?
